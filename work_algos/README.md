# Work Algos

This folder contains files that walk through the construction of common data structures.  The data structures are broken up into the methods that modify them making it easiert to understand what we are doing to the data structures on a core level when we implement various algorithims.

---

## Common Data Structures:

1. Lists and Pointer structures
2. Stacks and Queues
3. Trees
4. Hashing and Symbol tables
5. Graphs

## Common Algorithims:

1. Sorting
2. Selection Algorithims
3. String Algorithims
